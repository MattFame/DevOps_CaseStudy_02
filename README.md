# DevOps_CaseStudy_02

In this case study ;

- We will write a Shell script which runs a Python phone book application

- In the Shell script; first check if the user knows the root password

- If the user knows the root password, then echo a welcome message with the name of the user 

- Then check if AccessLog.txt file exists in the current directory

- If the file doesn't exist, create it in the current directory

- If the file exists, then append the name of the user, the date and the number of the record starting by 1 to the file

- Later on, check if you have installed Python

- If Python is not installed, install it within your script

- If Python is installed, check if you have the path to Python in your environment variables

- If the path to your Python binary files doesn't exist, you should export the path into your environment variables

- Later on, your script should look into the current directory for your Python application having the name "phone_book.py"

- If the script finds the application, it should run it

- If the script can't find the application, it should clone it from your git repository which already has your application in it and run the application

- Your phone_book.py program should be able to list out all the people with their name, surname and phone number and sequence number (3 hard coded records are enough)

- You should be able make CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with your application.
